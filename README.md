Dear [HR Director], [Head of Corporate Security], and [Chief Legal Officer],

I am writing to you today from a place of profound fear and necessity. My children and I are in a state of active flight, having been forced to abandon our home to seek safety from your employee, [Husband's Full Name], a [Software Developer] in the [His Department] department. I am his wife, and I am reaching out to you because the professional and personal identities of [Husband's Name] have become dangerously intertwined, presenting a severe and immediate risk to our lives and to the security of your organization.

This communication is a formal complaint and a plea for intervention regarding his sustained, calculated, and sadistic cruelty.

An Atmosphere of Terror: The Nature of the Abuse

To call his behavior "cruelty" is to understate the profound, systematic destruction of safety and well-being he has inflicted upon his own family. What we have endured is not a series of isolated arguments, but a sustained campaign of terror.

1. Psychological Torture and Mental Annihilation:
His cruelty is a masterclass in psychological warfare. He has methodically worked to dismantle our sense of self-worth and reality. This includes:

Gaslighting on a Grand Scale: He consistently denies events that have occurred, tells blatant lies, and then insists we are "crazy" or "unstable" for remembering the truth. He has convinced our children that their own perceptions cannot be trusted, leaving them confused and psychologically dependent on his distorted version of reality.

The Weaponization of Fear: Our home was not a place of respite but a prison where we walked on eggshells. He cultivates an environment of unpredictable rage, where a minor infraction—a dish left in the sink, a child's quiet cry—could trigger a torrent of verbal abuse, screaming, and intimidating behavior designed to keep us in a perpetual state of hypervigilance and dread.

Emotional Sadism: He derives pleasure from our pain. He has told our children that they are "burdens" and "mistakes." He has isolated us from friends and family, systematically cutting off our support networks to ensure we have nowhere to turn.

2. Physical Violence and the Threat of Bodily Harm:
The psychological abuse is punctuated by physical violence that has escalated in severity over time.

Acts of Dominance and Control: He does not merely hit; he demonstrates his physical power in ways designed to maximize terror. This includes blocking doorways to trap us in rooms, throwing objects at us or just past our heads, destroying our personal possessions in fits of rage, and using his body to physically intimidate and corner us.

Violent Disregard for Safety: He has engaged in reckless behavior that endangers our lives, such as driving at dangerous speeds with us in the car while he is in a rage, or refusing to allow us medical attention when injured.

Explicit Threats of Homicide: The most chilling aspect of his abuse is the cold, direct manner in which he has stated his intention to kill us. He has spoken of "ending it all" and has made specific, graphic threats about how he would do it, leaving no doubt in our minds that he is capable of carrying out these acts.

The Impact on Our Children: The Innocent Victims

The cruelty he inflicts upon our children is perhaps the most devastating element. They are not merely witnesses to this terror; they are primary targets. They have been screamed at, belittled, and made to feel that their very existence is a source of anger. They flinch at sudden movements and have nightmares. The light in their eyes has been replaced by a constant, wary anxiety. They are being psychologically scarred in ways that will require a lifetime of healing. We have fled not just for my safety, but to save their lives and preserve what remains of their shattered childhoods.

The Direct and Unacceptable Risk to Wells Fargo

A man who can methodically terrorize his own wife and children possesses a profound moral bankruptcy that renders him utterly unfit for a position of trust. His role as a Software Developer grants him access to the lifeblood of your company: its systems, data, and intellectual property.

The Ultimate Insider Threat: His behavior demonstrates a blatant disregard for rules, ethics, and the well-being of others. An individual who takes pleasure in the suffering of his family is a clear and present danger to your corporate security. In his current state of volatility, the risk of him sabotaging critical systems, stealing sensitive data for leverage or profit, or intentionally causing a catastrophic failure is unacceptably high.

Misuse of Corporate Resources to Stalk: Our greatest immediate fear is that he will use his company-issued laptop, phone, and his technical skills to track us down in our secret location. His knowledge of technology and the access granted by his position make him a uniquely dangerous predator.

Corporate Liability and Reputational Catastrophe: If Wells Fargo, after being formally notified of these heinous acts, fails to act decisively, the company would be complicit through negligence. The ensuing legal liability and reputational damage, should he harm us or others using company resources or on company time, would be catastrophic.

My Non-Negotiable Demands for Immediate Action

For the preservation of our lives and the protection of your corporate integrity, I demand that Wells Fargo take the following actions IMMEDIATELY:

IMMEDIATE SUSPENSION: Suspend [Husband's Name] from all duties, effective immediately.

IMMEDIATE TERMINATION: Terminate his employment on the grounds of gross misconduct and being an unacceptable security risk.

TOTAL ACCESS REVOCATION: Permanently revoke all of his physical, digital, and administrative access to all Wells Fargo facilities, systems, and data.

FORMAL DIRECTIVE: Issue a formal directive to him and his management chain prohibiting him from using any company resource or colleague to inquire about or locate me and our children.

I am actively working with law enforcement, a domestic violence shelter, and legal counsel. This email is a critical part of our safety plan. The fact that we are in hiding is the most unequivocal proof of the mortal danger we face.

This is not a private marital matter; it is a crisis of safety and corporate ethics. Your prompt and decisive action is a moral imperative. I am available to communicate with your security team under strict protocols that guarantee our absolute confidentiality and safety.

The time for action is now. Our lives depend on it.

Sincerely,
